            This project is a web platform designed to provide users with an
            interactive gaming experience and the ability to communicate through
            a real-time chat. The application is built using modern technologies
            such as Spring Boot for the backend and Angular for the frontend,
            with the inclusion of WebSockets to enable real-time communication.
          </li>

            <strong>Real-Time Chat:</strong> The platform offers users the
            ability to communicate with each other through a real-time chat.
            Users can send text messages, and enjoy an interactive conversation
            experience.

            other in real-time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>MySQL Database:</strong> User information, profiles, and
